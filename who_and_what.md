### Summary:
Make a pokedex using mysql.
It includes:
  * Gen 1 pokemon(the first 151)
  * Their Number
  * Their Name
  * Element type(s)
  * Their evolution line, and their place in that line
  * The elements they're weak against
  * The elements they're strong against

It consists of consists of tables with two or three columns and multiple `FOREIGN-KEYS` that works best for the project.


How the tables are connected are detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1QFOMXx1jJfyQtt-R1Y13q3hGM5iva56B8hARUWqJC00/edit).

Our project uses `PROCEDURES` to fetch the necessary data, and uses JS, HTML and CSS to display information in the front-end.

In the UI, all the pokemon are listed as a button and the info is visible once a button is clicked.
