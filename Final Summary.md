# Final Summary

### Concise description of the project (including goals)
* A Pokedex using mySQL
* Holds the first generation (151) Pokemons
  * Displays the Pokemon type
  * Displays the evolution line (if any)
  * Displays the Strengths (according to type)
  * Displays the Weaknesses (according to type)
* Consists of tables with two or three columns and multiple `FOREIGN-KEYS` that works best for the project
* Use of `PROCEDURES` to fetch the necessary data
* Use of JS, HTML and CSS to display information in the front-end

### Abstract representation of the data model(s) used

### Goals achieved and goals not achieved
* We met ALL the goals we set at the beginning, which was mostly due to workload management and being on top of everything.

### Potential for future work
* Not hardcode the exceptions for eevee, but allow for other pokemon to also have the exception.
* Add more information.
* Add pictures.
* Add all the generations with their complexities.
* Fix some of the design flaws in the UI.

### Overall reaction
* We wish we saw the csv files that was already available online earlier. That just opens up door to so many possibilities. Other than
that we were satisfied with what we have minus a few UI hiccups.
* We are definitely open to sharing our project with future classes as we believe it has a pretty clear cut structure.
* A note to future students: if you are banking on the raltional data as much as we were, you probablby should use Neo4J instead of MySQL.
